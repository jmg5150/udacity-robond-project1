![alt text][image_0]

This repository contains my solution to Project 1 / Search and Sample Return for the Udacity Robotics Software Engineering Nanodegree. The base repository for this project can be found [here](https://github.com/udacity/RoboND-Rover-Project). The required project writeup contains additional details regarding the implementation and performance and can be viewed [here](/writeup.md) 


## Performance Summary
I recorded videos of two trial runs and uploaded them to YouTube for easy viewing:

[Trial #1](https://youtu.be/wdaQHUwA1lo)

[Trial #2](https://youtu.be/oprh2u0FQSQ)

| Trial # | Mapped % | Fidelity % | Located Rocks | Collected Rocks | Runtime | 
|---------|----------|------------|---------------|-----------------|---------|
| 1       | 54.7%    | 79.4%      | 1             | 1               | 254.4s  |
| 2       | 41.1%    | 70.0%	  | 2			  | 2               | 274.4s  |
